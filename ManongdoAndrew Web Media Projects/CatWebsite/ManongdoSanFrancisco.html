    <h1> San Francisco has the best and the worst</h1>
    <h2> The Best Neighborhood is Bernal Heights</h2>
    <p><Strong><em> Bernal heights is the best neighborhood out there!</em></Strong> I Love Bernal Heights, i love getting up in the morning just to see the beatiful view of San Francisco in the morning. I also love watching the Sunset in the evening. whenever you're hungry the stores and restaurants are just a 5 minute walk away. The Food up there is amazing if anything i d say there are 5 star restaurants up there, some of them are even open at night and its a perfect thing to end the day off on. Although the movies is a far off drive from the neighborhood sometimes we have an outdoor movie night which totally substitutes for a movie theater. 
        <h2> The Worst neightborhood is Excelsior </h2>
